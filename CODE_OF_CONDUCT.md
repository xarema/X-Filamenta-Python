# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.

- **Respectful communication** — Listen to others, value different perspectives
- **Inclusive language** — Use language that is welcoming to all backgrounds
- **Constructive feedback** — Provide helpful, actionable feedback on code and ideas
- **Accountability** — Take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them
- **Collaboration** — Work together to solve problems and improve the project
